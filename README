Generic stack data structure

This, like all the other C data structure repositories on my Github,
was made so that neither you nor I will ever have to rewrite any of them
again for any other projects in the future.

Full documentation on usage is found in Stack.h

Structs:
	struct StackNode:
		- Wrapper struct for storing data in a Stack
	Stack:
		- LIFO data structure

Stack Creation Functions:
	Stack Stack_init()
		- Creates a Stack and initializes it to an empty Stack

Stack Insertion and Removal Functions:
	void Stack_push(Stack* stack, void* data)
		- Adds a new element to the top of the stack
	void* Stack_pop(Stack* stack)
		- Removes the top element from the stack and returns it

Stack Miscellaneous Functions:
	void* Stack_peek(const Stack* stack)
		- Returns the top of the stack
	int Stack_isEmpty(const Stack* stack)
		- Returns whether the stack is empty
	unsigned int Stack_count(const Stack* stack)
		- Returns the number of elements in the stack
	void Stack_clear(Stack* stack, void (*destroy)(void*))
		- Empties the stack
