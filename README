This is a struct called Stack that is a
generic stack data structure.

This, like all the other C data structure repositories on my Github,
was made so that neither you nor I will ever have to rewrite any of them
again for any other projects in the future.

Creating a Stack
Stack Stack_init()
Stack* Stack_create();

Insertion and Removal
void Stack_push(Stack* stack, void* data);
void* Stack_pop(Stack* stack);

Miscellaneous
void* Stack_peek(const Stack* stack);
int Stack_isEmpty(const Stack* stack);
unsigned int Stack_count(const Stack* stack);
void Stack_clear(Stack* stack, void (*destroy)(void*));
